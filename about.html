                <p>DUE DATE: Tuesday, May 21 (4PM)</p>
                <p>Final code must be committed to a Github branch (call it “Assignment1”) by the above
                    date and time</p>
<h2>Message List Website!</h2>
<p>For the first assignment, you’ll be creating your own message list website (sort of like Twitter,
but much less ambitious!). This should provide you with a gentle introduction to the three
    technologies that were covered during the workshop (HTML, CSS, JS).</p>
                <p>We’re expecting the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>An HTML file that loads a CSS file and a JS file</li>
                <li>A navbar (should have functioning links to at least a home page (the main page where
your message list is), and an about page (brief information about yourself, the project,
etc.))</li>
                <li>A form with some kind of text input or textarea, to write out a message, as well as a
button to add the message to a list, and a button to clear the form</li>
                <li>A stringified JSON object that holds initial messages (should be pre-filled with messages
so that there are messages in the list when the site loads … and you can parse it into an
object) … this is a string!</li>
                <li>A list (likely unordered), made up of list items that contain the message text (it should be
updated with the new message whenever you click the add button)</li>
                <li>A button to clear the list of messages</li>
                <li>Sufficient styling (showing some effort to upgrade the site from basic HTML), which may
include things like:
                    <ul><li>Text color</li>
                    <li>Background color</li>
                    <li>Different positioning</li>
                    <li>Sizing (width, height), padding, margins</li>
                        <li>Etc.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                <li></li>
                </ol>
                
            </div>
            <div class="footer">
                footer
            </div>
        </div>
